      <h2 class="section-title text-center">Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        We envision a future where JamDate becomes the go-to platform for love in the Caribbean. Not just for casual matches, but for people who are serious about building a future with someone who truly understands where they come from and where they're going.
      </p>
      <p>
        We see relationships built on shared laughter, cultural pride, family values, and mutual respect. Our dream is to see JamDate couples dancing at weddings, raising families, and building legacies — all because they took that first step with us.
